# Text Encryption and Decryption Web Application

This Flask-based web application allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using both AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) encryption algorithms. It features a user-friendly interface for inputting text, selecting the encryption method, and providing necessary keys.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text using AES or RSA encryption algorithms.
- Simple and intuitive web interface.
- Error handling for key import, encryption, and decryption.
- Secure communication using industry-standard encryption methods.

## Setup

1. Install Python 3.x and pip.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`.
5. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. Input text to be encrypted or decrypted.
2. Select the encryption method (AES or RSA).
3. Provide necessary keys for encryption or decryption.
4. Click the "Submit" button to perform the operation.
5. View the result in the web interface.
